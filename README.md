# Marks Analysis Using PySpark

This project demonstrates how to analyze student marks using PySpark.

## Features:
- Load dataset with student marks in various subjects.
- Handle data cleaning, including missing or non-numeric entries.
- Assign grades based on calculated total marks.
- Showcase basic PySpark transformations and conditional logic.

## Tools and Technologies:
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Python 3
- Git & GitHub for version control

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install PySpark.
3. Run the Python script or notebook to see the analysis.

## Dataset:
The attached dataset `MIDMARKS-Spark.csv` contains marks for multiple students.

#  Marks Analysis Using PySpark

This project is a **case study on student marks analysis** using **Apache Spark (PySpark)**.
The goal is to process raw marks data, clean it, transform it, calculate totals, assign grades, and generate meaningful insights with visualizations.

---

##  Features

✔️ Data cleaning (handling `A`, `AB`, `MP`, `null` values)
✔️ Total marks calculation & percentage computation
✔️ Grade assignment based on performance
✔️ Exploratory analysis with Pandas & Seaborn visualizations
✔️ Cross-tabulations and heatmaps for deeper insights
✔️ Integration of **PySpark (Big Data)** with **Pandas (Analysis & Visualization)**

##  Tech Stack

* **Python** 
* **PySpark**  (for big data processing)
* **Pandas** (for lightweight analysis)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  (for data visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## What I Learned

* How to use **PySpark DataFrames** for real-world data cleaning & transformations
* Integrating **Big Data (Spark)** with **Data Analysis (Pandas)**
* Creating **data pipelines** for analysis and reporting
* Building **visual stories** with Seaborn & Matplotlib


## Future Enhancements
